# cookiescope

Cookiescope is a command line tool to query browser cookies.

Run `cookiescope -h` or (`--help`) for more information.

Note that Chrome cookie values are not displayable as clear text due to
encryption. People have attempted various solutions, but it has proven to be a
moving target.

See TODO.md for hints about missing features and future enhancements.

## Caveats

This has only been used with MacOS Safari, except for very brief testing with
other browsers on MacOS.

Consider it ready to use with MacOS Safari, but more of a framework and starting
point for other browsers and operating systems.

For any developer that wishes to extend it, the framework is designed for easy
expansion and adaptation.

**The current project owner would be more than happy to hand off ownership of
this project.** Ideally, it would to someone who is willing to invest time in
increasing browser/OS coverage, fixing bugs, and providing support.
